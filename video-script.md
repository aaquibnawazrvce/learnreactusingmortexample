## Duration: 8-10 minutes

---

## Opening (0:00 - 0:30)

**[Show the application homepage]**

"Hello everyone! Welcome to this tutorial on the US Mortgage Calculator. Whether you're a first-time homebuyer or looking to refinance your existing mortgage, this free online calculator will help you understand exactly what your monthly payments will look like. Let's dive in!"

---

## Introduction (0:30 - 1:00)

**[Scroll slowly through the page]**

"This calculator is completely free to use and works on any device - your phone, tablet, or computer. Before we start calculating, I want to show you something cool at the top of the page."

**[Point to social sharing buttons]**

"You can easily share this calculator with friends or family who are also looking to buy a home. Just click on WhatsApp, Facebook, Telegram, LinkedIn, Twitter, or email to send them the link. It's that simple!"

---

## Main Calculator Overview (1:00 - 2:00)

**[Show the full calculator interface]**

"Now, let's look at the main calculator. On the left side, we have all our input fields where you'll enter your loan details. On the right side, you'll see the results update in real-time as you make changes. This instant feedback makes it super easy to compare different scenarios."

**[Point to the vertical ad space on far left]**

"You'll notice we have some ad space here on the left side that helps keep this tool free for everyone to use."

---

## Home Price & Down Payment (2:00 - 3:30)

**[Click on Home Price field]**

"Let's start with the basics. First, enter your home price. For this example, let's say we're looking at a home that costs $400,000."

**[Type $400,000]**

"Next is the down payment. This is the amount you'll pay upfront. Let's say we have $80,000 saved for our down payment."

**[Type $80,000]**

"Notice how the calculator automatically shows us that this is 20% of the home price. This is important because if your down payment is less than 20%, you'll typically need to pay PMI - Private Mortgage Insurance - which we'll talk about in a moment."

**[Point to the percentage display]**

"See right here? It shows '20.0% of home price'. This instant feedback helps you understand where you stand."

---

## Interest Rate & Loan Term (3:30 - 5:00)

**[Click on Interest Rate field]**

"Next up is the interest rate. This is the annual percentage rate your lender will charge you. Interest rates change based on market conditions and your credit score. Let's use 6.75% for this example."

**[Type 6.75]**

"Now, the loan term - this is how long you'll be paying off the mortgage. Most people choose between 15, 20, or 30 years. The longer the term, the lower your monthly payment, but you'll pay more interest over time."

**[Click dropdown and show options]**

"For a standard mortgage, let's select 30 years. But here's a cool feature - if you want a different term, maybe 25 years or 40 years, just select 'Custom' from the dropdown."

**[Select Custom]**

"See? Now you can type in any number of years between 1 and 50. Let's stick with 30 years for now."

**[Select 30 years again]**

## Monthly Payment Results (5:00 - 6:00)

**[Point to the Monthly Payment card]**

"Look at this! Our monthly payment is calculated instantly. For a $400,000 home with $80,000 down at 6.75% interest over 30 years, our monthly payment is [READ THE AMOUNT]."

**[Point to Payment Breakdown table]**

"The payment breakdown shows exactly where your money goes each month:

- Principal & Interest: This is the actual loan payment
- Property Tax: Your annual property taxes divided by 12
- Home Insurance: Your yearly insurance divided by 12
- And if applicable, PMI and HOA fees"

**[Scroll to Loan Summary]**

"Down here in the Loan Summary, you can see critical information like:

- Your total loan amount after the down payment
- The Loan-to-Value ratio (LTV)
- Total interest you'll pay over 30 years
- And the complete cost of the loan"

"This total interest number might surprise you - it's often more than the house itself! That's why it's important to compare different scenarios."

---

## Additional Costs (6:00 - 7:00)

**[Scroll back to input fields]**

"Now let's talk about additional costs. These are the expenses beyond your principal and interest."

**[Click on Property Tax field]**

"Property Tax: This varies by location. In some states it's 1% of your home value, in others it could be 2-3%. Let's enter $5,000 per year."

**[Type 5000]**

**[Click on Home Insurance field]**

"Home Insurance: Typically ranges from $1,000 to $3,000 per year depending on your location and coverage. Let's say $1,500."

**[Type 1500]**

**[Point to PMI field]**

"PMI - Private Mortgage Insurance: Since we put down 20%, we don't need PMI. But if you're putting down less than 20%, your lender will require it. It usually costs 0.5% to 1% of your loan amount annually."

**[Point to HOA field]**

"HOA Fees: If your property is in a community with a Homeowners Association, enter those annual fees here. Not all properties have this, so you can leave it at zero if it doesn't apply."

---

## Comparing Scenarios (7:00 - 8:00)

**[Make changes to demonstrate]**

"One of the best features of this calculator is trying different scenarios. Let me show you."

**[Change down payment to $60,000]**

"What if we only put down $60,000 instead of $80,000? Watch how the monthly payment changes... and notice the warning!"

**[Point to PMI warning]**

"See? It's warning us that we'll need PMI because our down payment is now less than 20%. Let's add $3,200 per year for PMI."

**[Add PMI amount]**

"Now you can see exactly how much that affects your monthly payment."

**[Change interest rate]**

"What if we could get a better interest rate? Let's try 6.0% instead of 6.75%."

"Look at that difference! Even a small change in interest rate can save you thousands of dollars over the life of the loan."
